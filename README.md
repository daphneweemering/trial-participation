# Barriers and facilitators of clinical trial participation in neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**
*Background.* Study participants in clinical trials for neurodegenerative disorders are selected and unrepresentative for all patients with the disease. This limits generalizability of study results and makes the safety and efficacy of interventions unknown for the majority of patients. In this study, we aim to identify facilitators that promote study participation and could facilitate the inclusion of broader patient populations in clinical trials.

*Methods.* We conducted a systematic literature search of quantitative and qualitative articles reporting barriers and facilitators of clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases. Studies evaluating participation in non-interventional research were excluded. Barriers and facilitators were extracted; the frequency with which patients identified barriers/facilitators were pooled across studies and summarized as proportions.

*Results.* Thirty-six unique studies were included, enrolling a total of 5113 patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (n=1261), Parkinson’s Disease (n=2789), Huntington's Disease (n=696) or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (n=367). 

*Funding.* This study was funded by The Netherlands ALS Foundation (grant TRICALS-Reactive II).
