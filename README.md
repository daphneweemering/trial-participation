# Barriers and facilitators of clinical trial participation in neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis

**Abstract**
*Background.* There is a pressing need for effective therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, and clinical trials form a key step in the process. However, the percentage of trial participants is low, especially in minority groups. This ultimately leads to limited generalizability and underpowered trial results, both interfering in properly assessing new therapies. Insights in reasons why patients with neurodegenerative disease do (not) participate in clinical trials is a key step in improving participation rates. 

*Methods.* We systematically reviewed the literature for research reporting on barriers and/or facilitators to trial participation in neurodegenerative diseases. The qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis, the quantitative data was evaluated with meta-analyses. 


*Funding.* This study was funded by The Netherlands ALS Foundation (grant TRICALS-Reactive II).
